		<h3>BUHARI CALLS NIGERIAN YOUTHS LAZY</h3>
		<p>
			 An elder opens his mouth with wisdom, so says an African proverb. It is given that A president will always speak in favour of his people and country just as president Donald Trump of United States of America would constantly remind the world that it’s “America first.” Therefore, it is shocking, annoying and disappointing to hear Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari say unimpressive and alarming things about Nigeria’s youth at the business forum of Commonwealth Heads of Government in London the other day. He was quoted to have said: “Nigeria’s youth do nothing and want everything for free. A lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming, you know, that, Nigeria has been an oil producing country therefore they should sit and do nothing and get housing, healthcare, education free.”
Really, Nigerians do not yet know why Buhari seems so fond of putting the nation at edge any time he speaks abroad. It is easy for Buhari to write Nigeria’s youth off as lazy, uneducated and always demanding freebie because the country is an oil producing nation. But, to do so, is to wash his country’s dirty linen in public. The ruling APC promised to give Nigerian youth qualitative education, employment and even pay N5,000 stipends as relief package to unemployed fresh graduates among other mouth watering 2014 campaign promises. All these and more, have not been fulfilled by Buhari’s government since it clinched power. In spite of the hopes dashed, the resilience seen in the youth to move on needs commendation, not condemnation.

		<h3>MIRACLE WINS BIG BROTHER NAIJA DOUBLE WAHALA 2018 REALITY SHOW</h3>
			<p>
				Miracle has won the BBNaija 2018 edition!

The Prize is N45m in total, and Miracle is walking away with it, after 85 eventful days in the House, full of hope, intrigues, sex, betrayal and anxiety.

In his comment at the final event, General Manager, Marketing and Sales of MultiChoice, Martin Mabutho, said Double Wahala was “served hot.”


 
Miracle won with over 38% of the entire votes cast. In all, 170 million votes were cast in the 85-day event, with 30 million votes coming in this week alone.

Miracle’s real name is Miracle Igbokwe. He was born on the 17th of February 1995.

Miracle attended the International Aviation College and the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology, Zaria. He finished from Dee Unique International High School.

Newly graduated from the aviation school, Miracle flies into the House with his pilot license firmly in hand. He feels grateful for everything in life as he knows how financially difficult it was to get there.

Miracle’s love of dancing and camping is only parallel by his sense of fashion, especially his skinny jeans. Miracle hates inequality and says he’s not in the game for the money.

When he was asked what irritates him most in other people, he said, “People being fake makes me not to trust them.”

Miracle and Nina had the first kiss and make-out session in the house. They both made it to the final five, but Nina was among the three final evictees on the last day of the reality show, leaving Miracle and Cee-C to contend for the coveted prize.

Miracle’s Instagram Handle is: @miracleikechukwu
His Facebook Profile is: Miracle Igbokwe
His Twitter Profile is: @Miracle860

While in the house, Miracle was once embroiled in a drama when a wedding band was spotted on his ring finger in some old photos that Nigerians dug up.

His brother, Samuel debunked the claims that Miracle was married. He also explained how the ring on his finger came to be.
Miracle’s will to win has always been rewarded by his ability to give his all in every challenge given to him. Whether it’s the head of house, a task or the Arena games, he always brought his A-game.

So, when he was announced as the overall winner for the Payporte’s Arena games, it came as no surprise, as he’s won more than any other housemate.

With an overall time of 53 minutes and 30 seconds throughout the season, Miracle was awarded a cash prize of N1m.
